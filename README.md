# Week 11 – Customer Segmentation & Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms and building churn prediction models for each segment.

The goal is to improve business decision-making through data-driven customer profiling and predictive modeling.

---

## Objectives

- Segment customers using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Build separate Random Forest models for each segment
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate models using multiple performance metrics
- Generate business recommendations

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Project Structure


---

## Clustering Algorithms Used

- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering

Optimal cluster number determined using Elbow Method.

---

## Prediction Model

- Random Forest Classifier
- Class weight balancing for imbalanced data
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

Segment-based modeling improves targeted retention strategies.

---

## Key Insights

- Contract type and tenure are major churn drivers
- Month-to-month customers show higher churn
- Segment-specific strategies increase marketing efficiency

---

## Business Impact

This project demonstrates how segmentation combined with predictive modeling can:

- Reduce churn
- Improve retention ROI
- Enable targeted marketing strategies
- Increase customer lifetime value
